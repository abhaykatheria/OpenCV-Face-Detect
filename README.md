# OpenCV-Face-Detect
Detecting face using OpenCV library.
OpenCV is the library which is used to deal with graphics, images and videos. It is a multipurpose library.
In this script, I have used openCV to detect faces in a given image.
the openCV's multi scale detection uses viola jones algorithm to detect harr like features of the faces in a given image. 
The harr cascade file is actually the result of supervised machine learning which contains what to look in image.
